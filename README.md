# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Inspired by the work done at [Green Chameleon Studio](https://dribbble.com/greenchameleon "Green Chameleon Studio").
The animations seen on their feed are primarily done in After Effects so I wanted to set out to recreate some of the effects using either simple css or javascript.
This particular animation was inspired by [this meetup animation](https://dribbble.com/shots/6136070-Los-Angeles "Green Chameleon animation").
Utilizes the [Parallax.js library by wagerfield](https://github.com/wagerfield/parallax "parallax.js").
